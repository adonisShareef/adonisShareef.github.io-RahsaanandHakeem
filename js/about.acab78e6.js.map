In 2009, he moved cross-country to attend Howard University in Washington, D.C. There, he gained exposure to a wide array of musical sounds and vibes. Though he began to seriously pursue his musical passions in 2011, it wasn’t until 2014’s transition to Chicago that notes began falling into all the right places. Citing Timbaland, Kanye West, and Dr. Dre as musical influences, Rahsaan’s sound has been described as “smooth, chill, and cinematic.” He has worked with independent and underground artists such as TigerNoTony, M.R.B, Teddy Hughes, Jordan Taylor, and more. Rahsaan holds a B.A. in Pan African Studies (University of Louisville, ’20) and certification in Music Technology (Harold Washington College, ’16). Hakeem joined his father’s musical journey at just 4 months of age. His birth served as the necessary inspiration for the launch of R&H. In addition to production, Hakeem occasionally provides vocals to tracks. His sound has been described as “joyous and free-spirited.” \")])])}]\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./About.vue?vue&type=template&id=e88ef89c&scoped=true&\"\nvar script = {}\nimport style0 from \"./About.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=e88ef89c&scoped=true&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"e88ef89c\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports"],"sourceRoot":""}
